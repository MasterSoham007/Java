Method Overloading:

Method Overloading promotes Virtual Polymorphism.

C Language:
In Dennis Ritchie's C language, any number of functions can be created. However, it is a rule in C language that no two functions can have the same name. This rule was made to avoid ambiguity (confusion) to the compiler, whenever a function is called.
This simple rule had put the developers into a lot of trouble as now they had to remember multiple function names for the same activity. Hence, the disadvantage of this approach is it is not user-friendly.

The limitation of C language was overcome in C++. Hence, it is possible to create multiple functions with the same name in C++. This process is referred to as Function Overloading in C++.
This feature of C++ was carried ahead as it is in Java as well.

In other words, in Java, we can create multiple methods within a class having the same name.

The process of creating multiple methods in a class having the same name but with different parameters is reffered to as Method Overloading. The advantage is it promotes ease of use.

The name conflict in Method Overloading is overcome by the Java Compiler using the following steps:

1. Name of the Method
2. Number of Parameters
3. Data types of Parameters
4. Sequence of Data Types of Parameters
