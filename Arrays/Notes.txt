Traditional approach of storing the data by creating variables is a good approach if small amount of data has to be stored. However, if large amount of data has to be stored then this approach fails because of the following limitations:
1. Creation is tedious.
2. Accessing the data is difficult.
3. Length of the code increases.
4. Suitable to store only small amount of data.

To overcome the above limitations, we have to use the array approach to store large amount of data because it has following advantages:
1. Creation is simple.
2. Accessing the data is easy.
3. Length of the code reduces.
4. Suitable to store large volumes of data.

Definition:

An array is an indexed data structure used to store large volumes of homogeneous data.
To store the elements of an array, contiguous memory locations are allocated.
Arrays are objects in Java.
